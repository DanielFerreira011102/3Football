      `El País report today that the question of image rights is crucial in Kylian Mbappé's decision over his future, to the point of considering renewing with Paris Saint-Germain.

Real Madrid's fourth offer to the 23-year-old, who is out of contract in over a month, consisted of the Spanish club taking 50% of his image rights, a condition which has left his lawyers perplexed.
The Spanish side's latest offer, made in March, would see the Frenchman take home a €180m signing-on fee and a €40m net salary.
Sources close to the player indicate that the offer was previously seen favourably, before the image rights clause - which is a staple in Merengue contracts since Florentino Pérez took charge of the club – was brought up.
Real Madrid and their lawyers believe that Mbappé's arrival at the Bernabéu would exponentially increase his marketing value, with the World Cup winner’s team – led by Delphine Verheyden – consider that he has become a household name without them so far.
Over the last two years of negotiations, Mbappé's team indicate that the image rights clause had never been brought up, while a contract was put forward in January whereby the player would pay a fine should he not join Real Madrid at the end of the season, and vice versa if the club turned him down.
The question of image rights has notably seen Mbappé boycott sponsorship duties with the France national team in the recent international break, while PSG’s latest offer would allow him to control 100% of his income from these.

Mbappé has yet to make a final decision on his future, with his representatives in talks with both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain and all options remaining open for the time being.`,

      `When Manchester United re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo back in the summer, they believed his connection with Bruno Fernandes on the field could secure them the Premier League title. Certainly, it had the makings of a special partnership due to the outstanding talents of both men. But, after Saturday's 3-1 defeat to Arsenal and with just a few games to go, it seems something is broken between the pair.

Manchester United weren't as bad against Arsenal as they had been a few days previously. But Fernandes was equally poor in both matches, with the Portugal international starting to look a shadow of the player he was during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s tenure.
With Arsenal 2-1 ahead, United were given a penalty following a handball inside the box.

Many expected Ronaldo to step up, especially given the fact the 37-year-old had already netted earlier in the day.
Instead, however, it was Fernandes who was given the responsibility. Ultimately, the decision to give the former Sporting Lisbon star the duty backfired.
The United midfielder's tame effort struck the post and it was a turning point, with Arsenal proceeding to score another goal through Granit Xhaka in the closing stages.`,

      `England's World Cup opening game with Iran will take place on Monday November 21; Three Lions' clash with USA will be on Friday November 25; final group game against Scotland, Wales or Ukraine will be on Tuesday November 29; World Cup final is at 6pm (UK time) on December 18

When and where is the 2022 World Cup?
The 2022 World Cup is taking place in Qatar in the winter months rather than the usual summer ones, due to the heat.
The tournament kicks off on Monday November 21 at the Al Thumama Stadium when Senegal take on the Netherlands in Group A, with England vs Iran being the second game of the tournament in Al Rayyan. That game is followed by hosts Qatar against Ecuador at the Al Bayt Stadium.
The tournament kicks off on Monday November 21 at the Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor with a match that will feature the host country against Ecuador.

England will also play on the opening day when they take on Iran. Gareth Southgate's team will then finish Group B with games against the USA on Friday November 25 and versus either Scotland, Wales or Ukraine on Tuesday November 29.

The knock-out stage begins on Saturday December 3.
The final will be played at the Lusail Stadium in Doha a week before Christmas on Sunday December 18.`,

    `He is truly the best there is in every metric. His composure on the pitch is contagious his maturity and reading of the game legendary! His use of the force instead of his eyes is unmatched, also has the best pointing the game has ever witnessed. I been a United fan for 45 years and I know now we've truly reached the highest level we can with Harry as our fearless leader. Maguire 4 Eva!

"One of the most prolific centre-halves to ever grace the pitch. It's a shame he didn't have a professional contract during my time as manager. You will never see anyone bring out the beauty of football like Harry Maguire does" 
-Sir Alex Ferguson

"Harry Maguire is the most versatile player i've ever seen. Can play for both sides in a game. What a player!"
- Ole Gunnar Solskjaer

I am in my mid thirties and barely touched a football in an organized team in my life. But seeing Harry Maguire gives me hope that I can one day become a professional footballer in a major team with a hefty salary.
Thank you Harry, you are an inspiration.

He makes the game interesting to watch. You can bet on one thing, if harry Maguire is on the pitch there cannot be a 0-0 ever. It's impossible. You can't guarantee that even with Messi and Ronaldo.`,
